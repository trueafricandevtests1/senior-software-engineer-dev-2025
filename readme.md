# 🚖 Ride-Sharing Service Backend

## 📌 Overview
This project is a high-performance ride-sharing backend designed for scalability and reliability, demonstrating:
- **Advanced Algorithm Design** → Efficiently assigning drivers to riders using optimized geospatial queries.
- **API Integrations** → Fetching real-time driver locations from geolocation APIs with caching strategies.
- **Cloud-Native Deployment** → Kubernetes-based deployment with auto-scaling and CI/CD automation.
- **Security & Performance Best Practices** → JWT authentication, rate-limiting, and observability.

---

## 🚀 Features
✅ **Optimized Ride-Matching Algorithm** - Uses geospatial indexing using Redis Geo for efficient distance calculations.
✅ **Real-Time Geolocation Fetching** - Integrates with Google Maps API (or OpenStreetMap) with rate-limited caching.
✅ **Deployment** - Containerized with docker, scalable microservices, and automated CI/CD pipeline (demostrate with either github actions or gitlab ci yaml file).
✅ **Secure & Performant** - Implements JWT authentication, rate-limiting, and monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana).
✅ **Bonus:** Caching (Redis), WebSockets for real-time updates, and payment processing.

## 🔌 API Endpoints
| Method | Endpoint            | Description                        |
|--------|---------------------|------------------------------------|
| POST   | `/request-ride`     | Request a ride, match driver      |
| GET    | `/drivers`          | List available drivers            |
| GET    | `/ride-status/:id`  | Track an ongoing ride             |
| POST   | `/auth/login`       | User authentication (JWT)         |

Example Request:
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/request-ride" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" -d '{ "lat": 40.7128, "lon": -74.0060 }'
```

---

## 🌍 Deployment
### Deploy with Docker
1. **Build & Push to Container Registry**
```bash
docker build -t ride-sharing-backend .
docker tag ride-sharing-backend your-container-registry/ride-sharing
docker push your-container-registry/ride-sharing
```
---

## 🧪 Running Tests
```bash
# Run unit tests
go test ./...
# or
npm test
# or
pytest
```

---

## 📊 Observability & Logging
✅ **Metrics** → Integrated with Prometheus & Grafana for monitoring.  
✅ **Logging** → Uses structured logging with ELK stack or Cloud Logging.  
✅ **Tracing** → OpenTelemetry-based distributed tracing.  

---

## 💡 Future Improvements
🔹 Implement **real-time ride tracking** using WebSockets.  
🔹 Add **multi-region failover** for high availability.  
🔹 Implement **dynamic pricing** based on demand.
